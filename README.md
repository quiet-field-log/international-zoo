🏛️ A Guide to the International Organization Zoo
(Admission is free. Responsibility is not included.)

This zoo is jointly operated by multiple countries.

The more operators there are,
the more responsibility is deferred,
and the more unstable the system becomes.

────────────────────────────────

Entrance Sign (Multilateral Cooperation Model)

We do not directly protect animals.

We protect international agreements
concerning the protection of animals.

We will protect these agreements
until the tears of a bird that cries once every thousand years
fill an entire ocean.

These agreements
have been translated into
a very large number of languages.

Human anguish and leadership
are not protected.

Visitors feel reassured.

From this sign, filled with ambiguity,
they experience one unmistakable feeling—
perhaps the only such certainty
they will ever feel in their lifetime.

🐘 Hall 1: The Elephant Pavilion (Existence Is Massive)

Notice

Within this pavilion,
a very important elephant
is considered to exist.

(Its actual existence is not within our jurisdiction.)

Visitor:
“Where is the elephant?”

Staff:
“The elephant is located
within a space where national sovereignty is respected.”

Visitor:
“Then why does this pavilion exist?”

Staff (naturally):
“We internationally recognize the elephant.”

────────────────────────────────

🦒 Hall 2: The Giraffe Pavilion (Inter-Agency Cooperation)

There is no actual giraffe.

Instead, telephones and video-conference screens
are elaborately displayed.

Notice

This pavilion does not handle giraffes directly.

It regularly consults
with other pavilions
that handle giraffes.

The connection tone must always ring clearly,
and meetings must always feel insufficient
for results to be achieved.

────────────────────────────────

🐒 Hall 3: The Monkey Pavilion (Operational Constraints)

Temporarily closed.

Notice

Direct interaction with monkeys
is currently restricted
due to technical and administrative limitations.

Visitor:
“When will it reopen?”

Staff:
“When the opinions
of the relevant stakeholders
have been sufficiently gathered.”

Additional Notice

Opinions have already been sufficiently gathered,
and no further collection
is deemed necessary.

────────────────────────────────

🦉 Hall 4: The Owl Pavilion (Preservation of Expertise)

There is no sound.
There is no movement.

As the pavilion ages,
belief grows lighter,
the signboards darken,
and it becomes time
to replace the signs.

Notice

This pavilion focuses on
the preservation
of accumulated dust.

────────────────────────────────

🐢 Hall 5: The Tortoise Pavilion (Sustainable Waiting)

Notice

This pavilion sustainably awaits
the arrival of the tortoise.

It practices
the aesthetics of slowness.

────────────────────────────────

📦 Special Exhibition: The Archive of Records and Agreements

There are no animals.

There are many documents.

Declarations on the importance of protection.
Reports on why protection is difficult.
Reconfirmations that protection is necessary.

The preservation status
is perfect.

🤔 Visitor Reviews

“Because no one takes direct responsibility,
I actually felt more at ease.”

“There were no animals,
but I could feel the system.”

“Even if something doesn’t work here,
it feels like someone, somewhere,
already knows.”

────────────────────────────────

🎯 Observational Findings

Animals belong to individual countries.
Responsibility belongs to everyone.
Therefore, it belongs to no one.

────────────────────────────────

🧊 Conclusion

This zoo
does not exhibit animals.

Until the day of death,
it gazes up at the sky,
hoping that
at least one animal exists.

Tonight as well,
the zoo’s signboards do not disappear.

They merely evolve.

And that structure
is maintained
in a very international manner.
